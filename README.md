# SuPa-Match: High-Resolution 3D Shape Matching with Global Optimality and Geometric Consistency

Official repository for the SGP 2025 paper: High-Resolution 3D Shape Matching with Global Optimality and Geometric Consistency by Nafie El Amrani, Paul Roetzer and Florian Bernard (University of Bonn & Lamarr Institute).

 We compute geometrically consistent matchings between two (high-resolution) 3D shapes with our two-stage pipeline:
1. We solve our optimisation problem **PATCH-MATCH** to find a geometrically consistent matching of (automatically computed) patches on the source shape and the target shape (patches are *only* defined on the source shape)
2. For every corresponding patch we solve our optimisation problem **SURF-MATCH** to find a dense and geometrically consistent matching between both patches while respecting edge-correspondences from stage 1  

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites 
You need a working c++ compiler and cmake. Note: builds are only tested on unix machines.

### Installation Step-by-Step
1. Create python environment
```shell
conda create -n supamatch python=3.8
conda activate supamatch
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
git clone git@github.com:NafieAmrani/SuPa-Match.git
cd SuPa-Match
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install GeCo (code to create the Patch-Match & Surf-Patch integer linear programs)
```shell
git clone TODO
cd TODO
python setup.py install
cd ..
```

3. Retrieve a gurobi license from the [official website](https://www.gurobi.com/).

## 📝 Dataset
Datasets are available from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zbBs3NjUIBBmVebw38MC1nhu_Tpgn1gr/view). Put all datasets under `./datasets/` such that the directory looks somehow like this Two example files for `FAUST_r` shapes are included in this repository.
